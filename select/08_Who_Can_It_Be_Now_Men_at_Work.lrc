[00:17.57] Who can it be knocking at my door?
[00:21.55] Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more
[00:26.00] Can't you see that it's late at night?
[00:29.23] I'm very tired and I'm not feeling right
[00:33.45] All I wish is to be alone
[00:36.87] Stay away, don't you invade my home
[00:41.00] Best off if you hang outside
[00:44.28] Don't come in, I'll only run and hide
[01:02.78] 
[00:48.10] Who can it be now?
[00:51.29] Who can it be now?
[00:55.26] Who can it be now?
[00:58.64] Who can it be now?
[01:07.64] 
[01:03.29] Who can it be knocking at my door?
[01:06.89] Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor
[01:10.74] If he hears, he'll knock all day
[01:14.30] I'll be trapped and here I'll have to stay
[01:18.16] I've done no harm, I keep to myself
[01:21.89] There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
[01:25.67] I like it here with my childhood friend
[01:29.49] Here they come, those feelings again!
[01:47.99] 
[01:32.74] Who can it be now?
[01:36.00] Who can it be now?
[01:39.61] Who can it be now?
[01:43.49] Who can it be now?
[01:52.49] 
[01:47.81] Is it the man come to take me away?
[01:51.32] Why do they follow me?
[01:55.30] It's not the future that I can see
[01:58.83] It's just my fantasy, yeah
[02:11.83] 
[02:32.75] Ooh, who can it be now?
[02:37.00] Who can it be now?
[02:40.82] Who can it be now?
[02:44.52] Who can it be now?
[02:53.52] 
[02:48.95] (Ooh ooh) Who can it be now?
[02:56.12] (Oh, wee oh) Who can it, Who can it
[03:04.56] (Ooh ooh) Who can it be now?
[03:11.20] (Ooh ooh wee) Yeah yeah yeah
